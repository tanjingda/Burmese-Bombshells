      <p>I saw you sitting in the middle of your solitude</p>
      <p>There's something on your mind, I wish I knew</p>
      <p>But your cheek's on the table, your face the other way</p>
      <p>And your hair tells no secrets within its cascades</p>
      <p>I've heard the stories, I've seen them on guard</p>
      <p>Avoiding your shadow like porcelain shards</p>
      <p>But even if it's poison in your veins, I wanna howl your name</p>
      <br>
      <p>You take my feelings in a limousine</p>
      <p>And send them back in a hearse</p>      
      <p>Oh, you devour me like nicotine</p>
      <p>But I'd be lying if I said it hurt</p>
      <br>
      <p>Baby, I'll take you like a drag and never breathe</p>
      <p>You make me incomplete</p>
      <p>It's not fair, you're the missing chapter I'll never read</p>
      <p>You make me incomplete, you make me incomplete</p>
      <br>
      <p>I see my own demise, an overdose of butterflies</p>
      <p>There's something fatal about the look in your eyes</p>
      <p>But even if you set me aflame, I wanna howl your name</p>

    <p>Your polyester jacket was enough to keep me warm</p>
    <p>You lit a filtered cigarette as the storm went raging on</p>
    <p>Right there and right then under the bus shelter we owned</p>
    <p>I told you that I loved you and you told me to go home</p>
    <p>After all the time we spent, was I still just a kid?</p>
    <p>For the first time you really looked at me and you told me "That's not it"</p>
    <br>
    <p>And that I have so much life to live, so much love to give</p>
    <p>Well, I wanna give it all to you, in the dark and en soleil</p>
    <p>Our lives run parallel, can't you tell? Oh, can't you tell?</p>  
    <br>    
    <p>After all my tears had disappeared into the rain</p>
    <p>You offered me a cigarette to take away the pain</p>
    <p>I started coughing badly and you couldn't help but laugh</p>
    <p>For a moment I felt like I was your age, oh, why can't we forget the math?</p>
